# Nike Men's Shoes Question and Answer Model

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for a chatbot designed to answer questions about the Nike Men's Shoes Website based on its content. The notebook has been meticulously documented and contains detailed explanations and interpretations of each code cell to enhance understanding and usability.

## Overview

The primary goal of this notebook is to create a model that can fetch and interpret data from the Nike Men's Shoes website and answer relevant questions. This involves several key steps including data retrieval, question parsing, and answer generation.

## Detailed Steps

1. **Agent Description**: Define the context of the chatbot, specifying that it answers questions about the Nike Men's Shoes website.
2. **Data Retrieval**: Use `WebBaseLoader` to fetch relevant documents from the website.
3. **Question Parsing**: Utilize a retrieval mechanism to parse and understand the questions posed to the chatbot.
4. **Answer Generation**: Invoke a chain to generate appropriate responses based on the retrieved data.
5. **Test Suite**: Convert the test set into a comprehensive test suite to ensure the model's performance and reliability.
6. **Model Creation**: Define a Giskard model with a clear description, detailing its purpose and functionality.

## Detailed Documentation

### Agent Description

This section sets up the context for the chatbot. By defining the agent description, we inform the model about its specific domain and type of queries it will handle.

### Data Retrieval

Using `WebBaseLoader`, the notebook fetches content from the Nike Men's Shoes website. This content forms the basis for answering questions.

### Question Parsing

The model employs a retrieval mechanism to interpret the questions posed by users. This step is crucial for understanding the context and semantics of the queries.

### Answer Generation

Once the questions are parsed, the model invokes a chain to generate accurate and relevant answers based on the data retrieved from the website.

### Test Suite

To ensure the reliability of the model, the test set is converted into a test suite. This suite helps in systematically evaluating the model's performance.

### Giskard Model

The notebook defines a Giskard model named "Nike Men's Shoes Question and Answer Model". This model is tailored to handle questions specifically about the Nike Men's Shoes website.

## Conclusion

This notebook provides a comprehensive approach to building a question-answering model for the Nike Men's Shoes website. With detailed documentation and a step-by-step guide, users can easily understand and replicate the process.
